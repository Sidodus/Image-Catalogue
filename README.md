# Image-Catalogue
My 2nd DEV JS

This Repo was developed by Saheed Odulaja as a practice exercise while learning JavaScript, so feel free to fork the repo, leave a star and make suggestions.

The code consists of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript codes.

Little Bug That Needs Fix:
I implemented JS Iteration with a loop to reload the page and stay on the category when all images within a category is displayed, but most time the page reloads before the iteration count ends (this usually happens on first iteration session of different groups and normalizes thereafter).
